# The way to make games
It is very interesting but quite difficult to make games. All you can do is moving step by step, from easy to hard.
Do not underestimate simple games: they can make you think for a while especially if you are too perfectionist. Just try to concentrate on the core logics rather than unusable optimizations. Also I recommend to use full-fledged environment like Godot rather than separate libraries or frameworks.

1. Tic-tac-toe ([TicTacToe](TicTacToe/)).
1. Miner.
1. Snake.
1. Sea war.
1. ...
